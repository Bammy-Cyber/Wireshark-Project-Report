Wireshark Project Report — TCP 3-Way Handshake & Stealth and Decoy Scan Analysis
This report presents a Wireshark-based examination of a TCP three-way handshake between host 10.0.2.15 and server 66.29.153.49 on port 80. The packet capture was narrowed by TCP port and IP address to isolate the session. The analysis also reviews stealth scanning techniques — including SYN (stealth) scans, decoy scans, and time-fragmentation scans — explains how they may evade detection, and recommends strategies for their detection and mitigation
